// Write an asynchronous function that accepts a message string and a delay time in milliseconds. 
// The function should log the message to the console after the specified delay time.
function name(params) {

// You have an array of user IDs and a function getUserData(id) that returns a Promise with user
//  data when given a user ID. Write an asynchronous function that fetches and logs the data for 
// each user ID one by one, in sequence.


// You have an asynchronous function performTask() that returns a Promise. 
// The Promise resolves if the task is successful and rejects if there's an error. 
// Write a function that calls performTask() and logs a custom success message if the 
// task is successful, and a custom error message if there's an error.
